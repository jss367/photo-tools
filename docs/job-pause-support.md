# Pausing background jobs

Use **Pause** on a running job on the Jobs page, then **Resume** to continue
with its current progress. **Pausing…** means the worker is finishing its
current photo, batch, request, or analysis stage. **Paused** means it reached
a safe checkpoint. Resume requires the same running Vireo process; this is
not a checkpoint that survives restarting the application.

## Supported jobs

| Work | Pause boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Prepare full resolution, generate previews, cache originals for offline use | Between photos |
| Generate thumbnails, develop photos, extract subject masks | Between photos |
| Export photos, export for iNaturalist, move selected photos | Between photos and after export metadata finishes; active subprocesses finish before a pause is confirmed |
| Verify photo hashes | Between files, after committing the completed batch prefix |
| Adjust capture time | Between photos, after the metadata write and catalog update |
| Scan for duplicates | Between duplicate groups |
| Score sharpness | Between burst groups, saved scores, and automatic flags |
| Analyze photos for culling | Between scene-hash calculations and species groups, and before saving the final result |
| Regroup encounters and bursts | Between loading, grouping, and saving stages |
| Verify installed models | Between models |
| Fetch regional species labels | Between request progress updates |
| Import and organize photos | During discovery, between metadata batches of at most 100 files, and between copies; combined imports also use the scanner's pause coordination |
| Import Lightroom catalog keywords | Between photos, after committing completed keyword writes |
| Verify abandoned import staging folders | During directory enumeration and between files |
| Scan memory cards, verify archive copies, delete verified card files | During card discovery, between files or archive hash groups |
| Classify photos | Between photos and stages; label embedding computation checkpoints and releases shared cache locks before pausing |
| Precompute label embeddings | Between label batches, after saving resumable progress and releasing shared cache locks |
| Publish a website | During preparation, before the final replacement of published files |
| Scan folders, repair metadata, import in place, import photos, process pipelines | Existing coordinated checkpoints |

Cancelling a paused job wakes it so it can exit and perform its normal cleanup.
Completed work remains subject to the job's usual cancellation behavior.
An accepted pause during the final item is honored before the runner publishes
completion, after the worker has released its resources. Completed file writes
remain intact while the job waits for Resume or Cancel.

## Exceptions

These jobs deliberately remain without Pause in the current implementation:

| Work | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Download models, taxonomy, or Darktable | Downloads and setup delegate to external downloaders, active network streams, or installation steps. Their progress notifications do not establish a point where all work has stopped. Taxonomy installation also performs large database transactions. Supporting pause requires separate download and installation coordination. |
| Synchronize metadata to XMP sidecars | A job holds the shared synchronization lock while collecting and writing changes. Parking inside that operation would block other synchronization jobs. The lock and change snapshots need a resumable batch protocol. |
| In-place imports from a saved new-photo list | These imports hold a shared lock for the entire operation so concurrent imports cannot reuse the same saved list. Pausing would block those imports and delay their cancellation. Ordinary in-place imports support pause. |
| Move entire folders | Moves may hold a batch serialization lock and use external transfer tools, followed by catalog rebasing and source cleanup. Pausing requires coordinated transfer and catalog boundaries. Moving selected photos supports pause separately. |
| Work Locally: stage, synchronize, or discard, for either folders or workspaces | These transitions reserve shared folder or workspace state while switching between remote and local files. An indefinite pause can block other operations or leave a transition pending. |
| Batch deletion from the library or disk | Disk deletion and catalog reconciliation span multiple phases. Pausing between them could leave the catalog pointing to files already removed for an indefinite period. Verified memory-card deletion has a separate per-file protocol and supports pause. |
| Automatic startup backfills, missing-original scans, and new-image discovery | These are internal, ephemeral maintenance or discovery tasks rather than user-managed jobs. |

Website publishing's final replacement step is also uninterrupted, even when
Pause was available earlier in preparation. Once that commit step begins,
new pause and cancellation requests are rejected.

## Adding a new job

Keep pause opt-in with `pausable=True` on its launcher. Use
`runner.is_cancelled(job_id)` at a safe checkpoint when the worker handles
cancellation itself, or `JobLaunch.checkpoint(job)` when cancellation should
unwind the worker. Both retain the worker's local state during a pause.

Do not park while holding a database write transaction, a shared lock, an
inference permit, or while another worker or subprocess is still active.
Use `runner.cancellation_requested(job_id)` for cancellation-only probes inside
those operations. Multi-worker jobs must coordinate all participants before
publishing the paused state. Include `pausing` and `paused` in checks that
prevent another job from changing the same reserved state.
