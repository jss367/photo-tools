    ``label_descriptions.json`` or bioclip-2.5's ToL artifacts). Only
    those optional files present on disk right now are folded into the
    fingerprint. That way a Repair that lands a previously absent
    optional file flips the fingerprint and prevents the pre-repair
    cached classifier — which was constructed without that artifact and
    therefore emits different labels — from being reused.

    ``optional_files_state`` — a ``{filename: (size, mtime_ns) | None}``
    dict overriding current disk state for the named optional files.
    Files absent from the dict fall back to a live disk stat. Use this
    when a constructed classifier has recorded which optional artifacts
    it actually consumed, so the fingerprint post-construction matches
    the instance rather than a disk state that a concurrent heal has
    already changed underneath it — otherwise the stale pre-heal
    instance would be rekeyed to the healed fingerprint and every later
    acquirer would reuse it.
