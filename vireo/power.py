"""Keep the system awake while long-running jobs are in flight.

See issue #1397. A multi-hour import on battery is suspended by macOS idle
sleep roughly ten minutes in, and an SMB-over-Tailscale mount does not
survive the repeated sleep/DarkWake cycling — the job wakes to a share that
is no longer there.

Best-effort by design: if the platform tool is missing or fails, the job
still runs. Keeping the machine awake is a convenience; completing the
user's import is not.
